# ResumeBuilder
Resume Builder Application using Java
This project is to demonstrate everything I have learned from BCIS 3630 & BCIS 360, which are Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Enterprise Programming, respectively.

# Libraries Used
There are certain libraries that need to be uploaded to the project in order for it to run.
For Database access, use mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar or current version
For iText usage in PDFGenerator, use iText-Core-9.0.0-only-jars or current version
Lastly, use SLF4J for a simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks, allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time.
